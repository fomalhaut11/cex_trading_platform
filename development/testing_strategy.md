# Testing Strategy

## Layers

- Unit tests verify value objects and deterministic state transitions.
- Contract tests verify adapter-to-canonical mappings and schema compatibility.
- Integration tests verify bounded module pipelines and recovery behavior.
- Replay tests feed recorded events and compare deterministic state outputs.
- Security-boundary tests mutate signed fields, identities, validity windows
  and authorization scopes, and prove rejection occurs before state mutation.

## Baseline

Every public domain type requires construction, invariant and serialization
tests. Every state engine requires ordering, duplicate, gap and recovery tests.
No live exchange or network access is required by the default test suite.
